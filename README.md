## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As this was my first Frontend Mentor challenge and I'm still in the early stages of learning html/css, it was mostly for getting more familiar with the whole process.

### Continued development

My CSS still doesn't feel too clean. I'd like to learn more about mobile first development and media query.
